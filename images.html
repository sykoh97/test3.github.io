One strolls along lovely pathways and is greeted by spectacular orchid plants at every turn. A short walk leads into the Botanic Gardens and the Orchid Garden is located about 1 km from the park entrance. While the Botanic Gardens are free to visit, there is an entry fee of $5 dollars for the Orchid Garden.</p>

                            <p style ="color: Black; font-size: 24px ; text-align: center">The Swan Lake is a major attraction in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It was formerly also known as the Main Lake or the First Lake. It was constructed in 1866, shortly after the Gardens formation. It is considered to be the oldest ornamental water-feature in Singapore.

Home to numerous species of aquatic plants and fishes, the lake covers an area of slightly less than 1.5 hectares, with a depth of about 4 metres. The Swan Lake is named as such because of a pair of beautiful mute swans from Amsterdam that glide gracefully across the lake. These swans never fail to thrill visitors.

Another iconic feature of the lake is the island with its large clump of Nibong palms (Oncosperma tigillarium) which were recorded to be planted here in 1891. The Swan Lake also serves as an important water point to supply water for the Gardens’ plants around the Tanglin Core.</p>

                            <p style ="color: Black; font-size: 24px ; text-align: center"> The 240sqm SBG Heritage Museum is located in Holttum Hall, which is next to Botany Centre in the Tanglin Core of the Gardens. Built in 1921 to serve as the Director of the Gardens' office and laboratory, the two-storey building has been designated as an Urban Redevelopment Authority conservation building. This was where Professor Eric Holttum, the Gardens' Director from 1925 to 1949, developed the orchid breeding technique which enabled the efficient production of healthy seedlings in sterile flasks from a hybrid seed. This technique, which is still used today, was a key factor that stimulated orchid industries throughout the region.

The SBG Heritage Museum features interactive and multimedia exhibits and panels that detail the Gardens' rich heritage. Historical items that will be displayed include old photographs, artefacts, plant specimens, rare botanical books and botanical paintings that date back to the early 19th century. Oral recordings of Ridley during his 100th birthday will also be integrated into an interactive display. The exhibits in the Museum are supported by CDL through the Garden City Fund, a registered charity and institution of public character established by the National Parks Board.</p>
